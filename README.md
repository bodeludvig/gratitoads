# Gratitoad 
Gratitoad is a well-being focused web application where you interact with a cute frog — your personal Gratitoad. By feeding it with positive thoughts and gratitude, you help the frog grow happier — and support your own mental wellness.

When you write down worries or anxious thoughts, they are transformed into little bugs. Once you've given your Gratitoad enough gratitude, it can eat the bugs — symbolizing how you process and let go of those worries.

All your positive entries are saved as a personal gratitude journal that you can revisit whenever you need encouragement. Gratitoad is a playful and interactive tool for self-reflection, gratitude, and emotional balance.
